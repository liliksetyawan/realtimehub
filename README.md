# RealtimeHub

> 50 000-connection WebSocket fan-out for in-app notifications. `lesismal/nbio` epoll engine, sharded hub, Redis pub-sub for cross-node delivery, and sequence-based recovery so reconnecting clients catch up cleanly. A React + Redux SPA demonstrates the full UX end-to-end.

## Why this exists

Most "real-time demo" repos pick `gorilla/websocket`, open chat in two browser tabs, and call it a day. That's fine for tutorials — it falls over at scale. At 50 000 connections, the goroutine-per-connection model spends ~800 MB on stacks alone, the GC starts working overtime, and a single read/write goroutine pair becomes the bottleneck.

RealtimeHub is the **production-shaped** version of that problem:

- epoll-based netpoll (`lesismal/nbio`) — ~4-8 KB/conn vs 16+ KB
- sharded hub so register/broadcast on different users don't fight one mutex
- bounded write buffers so a slow consumer can't stall the broadcaster
- one ticker reaper instead of 50k per-conn timers
- kernel tuning script + documented load test that backs the number

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Browser((React SPA)) -->|"WebSocket"| WS

    subgraph Node["RealtimeHub node"]
      WS["WebSocket server<br/>(nbio epoll)"]
      Hub["Sharded Hub<br/>(16 shards)"]
      Sub["Redis subscriber"]
      WS <--> Hub
      Sub --> Hub
    end

    Admin([Admin Panel]) -->|"POST /v1/admin/notifications"| WS

    Hub -->|"persist"| PG[(PostgreSQL<br/>notifications)]
    Pub["Redis publisher"] -->|"PUBLISH<br/>notif:user:&#42;"| Redis{{"Redis<br/>pub-sub"}}
    Redis -->|"PSUBSCRIBE"| Sub

    WS -.->|"fan-out via"| Pub
```

A second node added to this picture changes nothing in the code — both nodes just publish to the same Redis pattern and subscribe to it. The local hub on each node delivers to its own connections.

### Saga of a single notification

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Admin
    participant API as Server (REST)
    participant DB as Postgres
    participant R as Redis
    participant WS as WebSocket Hub
    participant Client

    Admin->>API: POST /v1/admin/notifications
    API->>DB: BEGIN tx
    Note over DB: UPSERT user_offsets → next seq
    API->>DB: INSERT notification(seq=N)
    API->>DB: COMMIT
    API->>R: PUBLISH notif:user:alice
    API-->>Admin: 201 Created
    R-->>WS: pattern message
    WS->>WS: hub.SendToUser("alice", frame)
    WS-->>Client: notification (seq=N)
    Client->>Client: render toast + bump unread
```

### Reconnect with replay

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant WS as Server
    participant DB as Postgres

    Note over Client: connection drops · seq=42 last seen
    Client->>Client: backoff 1s + jitter
    Client->>WS: WebSocket connect (?token=...)
    WS->>DB: CurrentSeq("alice") → 47
    WS-->>Client: welcome { current_seq: 47 }
    Client->>WS: resume { from_seq: 42 }
    WS->>DB: SinceSeq("alice", 42, 200)
    DB-->>WS: notif 43..47
    WS-->>Client: notification × 5 (in seq order)
    Client->>Client: dedup by seq, render
```

## Patterns demonstrated

| Pattern | Where | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Epoll-based netpoll** | `internal/adapter/websocket` (nbio) | ~4 KB/conn instead of ~16 KB; the difference between fitting 50k on a 4 GB VM vs needing 16 GB |
| **Sharded hub** | `hub.go` — 16 shards keyed by `fnv32a(user_id)` | Register/Unregister/Broadcast on different users run in parallel |
| **Bounded write channel** | `connection.go` — buffer 64 per conn | Slow consumers get closed; the broadcaster never blocks |
| **One-timer reaper** | `hub.go` `StartReaper` | One ticker for ping + stale eviction beats 50k per-conn timers |
| **Atomic per-user seq** | `notifications.go` UPSERT on `user_offsets` | Concurrent inserts can't collide; replays are deterministic |
| **Cross-node pub-sub** | `internal/adapter/redis` (rueidis) | Adding a second node = zero code change; rueidis auto-reconnects on drop |
| **Sequence recovery** | `welcome` carries `current_seq`; client sends `resume { from_seq }` | No-message-loss across disconnects without server-side ack store |
| **Exponential backoff + jitter** | `hooks/useWebSocket.ts` | Avoids thundering-herd reconnect after a server restart |
| **JWT at handshake** | `auth/jwt.go` `Authenticate` reads `?token=` | Browsers can't set headers on WS upgrade — query param is the canonical workaround |
| **Hexagonal layout** | `domain` → `port` → `usecase` → `adapter` | Same shape as OrderFlow; easy to swap the publisher (e.g. NATS instead of Redis) |

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Bring up Postgres + Redis + Jaeger
make up

# 2. Run the server
cp .env.example .env
make run                 # listens on :8090

# 3. Run the SPA in another terminal
cd web && npm install && npm run dev   # opens http://localhost:5173
```

Demo users seeded in code:

| username | password | role |
|---|---|---|
| `alice` | `password123` | user |
| `bob` | `password123` | user |
| `charlie` | `password123` | user |
| `admin` | `admin123` | admin |

Workflow:
1. Tab 1 — log in as `alice`. Bell at top right; status pill shows "Connected".
2. Tab 2 — log in as `admin`. Click "Admin", select alice, type a notification, send.
3. Tab 1 receives the notification with no refresh — toast pops, bell badge animates, item appears at the top of the inbox.

To exercise reconnect:
- Stop the server (Ctrl+C). Tab 1 status flips to "Reconnecting · attempt N" with backoff.
- Start the server again. Tab 1 reconnects, sends `resume { from_seq }`, and any notifications you sent while it was offline replay in seq order.

```

The frontend's `useWebSocket.ts` is the headline FE piece — 100 lines of code that own the entire connection lifecycle: open with token, respond to server pings, replay missed seqs, exponential-backoff reconnect with jitter, dispatch into Redux on every frame.

## Library choice — why nbio

For 50k concurrent WebSocket connections on commodity hardware:

| Library | Model | Memory / conn | At 50k |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gorilla/websocket` | 1 goroutine read + 1 write | ~16 KB | ~800 MB stacks alone |
| `coder/websocket` (eks nhooyr) | Same goroutine model | ~16 KB | ~800 MB stacks |
| `gobwas/ws` + `mailru/easygo/netpoll` | epoll event loop | ~4 KB | ~200 MB |
| **`lesismal/nbio`** ★ | epoll, drop-in `net/http` | ~4-8 KB | ~200-400 MB |

`nbio` lands in the same scale tier as `gobwas+netpoll` but ships with a `net/http`-compatible API, so the REST handlers (login, admin send, list) live on the same engine as the upgrade endpoint — one server, one port. The library is actively maintained and has been used in production by several Chinese tech companies for messaging at scale.

## Kernel + ulimit tuning

50k WebSocket connections = 50k file descriptors. Default Linux limits stop you well before that. `scripts/tune-kernel.sh` (Linux only, sudo) sets:

| Knob | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `nofile` | 100000 | One fd per conn + epoll fds |
| `net.core.somaxconn` | 4096 | TCP accept backlog |
| `net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog` | 8192 | SYN queue size |
| `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range` | 1024 65535 | Loadgen needs ~50k ephemeral ports |
| `net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse` | 1 | Recycle TIME_WAIT slots |
| `net.core.{r,w}mem_max` | 16 MiB | Per-socket buffer cap |

If running under systemd, also add `LimitNOFILE=100000`. Under Docker, pass `--ulimit nofile=100000:100000`.

---

## Load test

```bash
sudo bash scripts/tune-kernel.sh
ulimit -n 100000
API_BASE=http://localhost:8090 WS_URL=ws://localhost:8090 \
  k6 run loadtest/ramp-50k.js
```

The scenario ramps 0 → 5k (30s) → 25k (1m) → 50k (2m), sustains 50k for 5 minutes, then drains. See [`loadtest/README.md`](loadtest/README.md) for run-time expectations and what to monitor.

## Tracing

OpenTelemetry tracing covers the full notification fan-out path:

```
HTTP request                  ← otelhttp middleware (root span)
  └─ usecase.SendNotification ← span around Execute
       └─ redis.publish       ← injects W3C `traceparent` into Frame
              ↓ via Redis ↓
            redis.subscribe   ← extracts `traceparent`, child span
              └─ hub.send_to_user ← attributes: user_id, hub.delivered
```

Enable export by setting `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4319` (the Jaeger container's OTLP HTTP port). The endpoint is empty by default — when unset, the tracer is a no-op and the server runs with zero overhead.

Open <http://localhost:16687> for the Jaeger UI and look for service `realtimehub`. A single admin notification produces one trace with five spans linked across the Redis hop via the W3C trace context header carried in `Frame.TraceParent`.
